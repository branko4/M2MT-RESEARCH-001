# Python script documentation
Note that the script contains bad code. But main purpose was only to translate a few properties quick and dirty. The initial plan was to translate the entire document to version 2.0.0, since it was detected that it was only version 1.2.3. Which would have mad it possible to check to correctness according to the XSDs. However since it was a larger translation then expected it was eventually reduced to only translate the three changed elements/ attributes.

The script covers:
- removal of all name elements
- addition of buffer stop type to all buffer stops
- change of position of location (since it would have been to costly to remove the location entirely it has remained inside the model)
